# LTX Desktop

LTX Desktop is an open-source desktop app for generating videos with LTX models — locally on supported Windows/Linux NVIDIA GPUs, with an API mode for unsupported hardware and macOS.

> **Status: Beta.** Expect breaking changes.
> Frontend architecture is under active refactor; large UI PRs may be declined for now (see [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](docs/CONTRIBUTING.md)).

## Features

- Text-to-video generation
- Image-to-video generation
- Audio-to-video generation
- Video edit generation (Retake)
- Video Editor Interface
- Video Editing Projects

## Local vs API mode

| Platform / hardware | Generation mode | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Windows + CUDA GPU with **≥32GB VRAM** | Local generation | Downloads model weights locally |
| Windows (no CUDA, <32GB VRAM, or unknown VRAM) | API-only | **LTX API key required** |
| Linux + CUDA GPU with **≥32GB VRAM** | Local generation | Downloads model weights locally |
| Linux (no CUDA, <32GB VRAM, or unknown VRAM) | API-only | **LTX API key required** |
| macOS (Apple Silicon builds) | API-only | **LTX API key required** |

In API-only mode, available resolutions/durations may be limited to what the API supports.

## System requirements

### Windows (local generation)

- Windows 10/11 (x64)
- NVIDIA GPU with CUDA support and **≥32GB VRAM** (more is better)
- 16GB+ RAM (32GB recommended)
- Plenty of free disk space for model weights and outputs

### Linux (local generation)

- Ubuntu 22.04+ or similar distro (x64)
- NVIDIA GPU with CUDA support and **≥32GB VRAM** (more is better)
- NVIDIA driver installed (PyTorch bundles the CUDA runtime)
- 16GB+ RAM (32GB recommended)
- Plenty of free disk space for model weights and outputs

### macOS (API-only)

- Apple Silicon (arm64)
- macOS 13+ (Ventura)
- Stable internet connection

## Install

1. Download the latest installer from GitHub Releases: [Releases](../../releases)
2. Install and launch **LTX Desktop**
3. Complete first-run setup

## First run & data locations

LTX Desktop stores app data (settings, models, logs) in:

- **Windows:** `%LOCALAPPDATA%\LTXDesktop\`
- **macOS:** `~/Library/Application Support/LTXDesktop/`
- **Linux:** `$XDG_DATA_HOME/LTXDesktop/` (default: `~/.local/share/LTXDesktop/`)

Model weights are downloaded into the `models/` subfolder (this can be large and may take time).

On first launch you may be prompted to review/accept model license terms (license text is fetched from Hugging Face; requires internet).

Text encoding: to generate videos you must configure text encoding:

- **LTX API key** (cloud text encoding) — **text encoding via the API is completely FREE** and highly recommended to speed up inference and save memory. Generate a free API key at the [LTX Console](https://console.ltx.video/). [Read more](https://ltx.io/model/model-blog/ltx-2-better-control-for-real-workflows).
- **Local Text Encoder** (extra download; enables fully-local operation on supported Windows hardware) — if you don't wish to generate an API key, you can encode text locally via the settings menu.

## API keys, cost, and privacy

### LTX API key

The LTX API is used for:

- **Cloud text encoding and prompt enhancement** — **FREE**; text encoding is highly recommended to speed up inference and save memory
- API-based video generations (required on macOS and on unsupported Windows hardware) — paid
- Retake — paid

An LTX API key is required in API-only mode, but optional on Windows/Linux local mode if you enable the Local Text Encoder.

Generate a FREE API key at the [LTX Console](https://console.ltx.video/). Text encoding is free; video generation API usage is paid. [Read more](https://ltx.io/model/model-blog/ltx-2-better-control-for-real-workflows).

When you use API-backed features, prompts and media inputs are sent to the API service. Your API key is stored locally in your app data folder — treat it like a secret.

### fal API key (optional)

Used for Z Image Turbo text-to-image generation in API mode. When enabled, image generation requests are sent to fal.ai.

Create an API key in the [fal dashboard](https://fal.ai/dashboard/keys).

### Gemini API key (optional)

Used for AI prompt suggestions. When enabled, prompt context and frames may be sent to Google Gemini.

## Architecture

LTX Desktop is split into three main layers:

- **Renderer (`frontend/`)**: TypeScript + React UI.
  - Calls the local backend over HTTP at `http://localhost:8000`.
  - Talks to Electron via the preload bridge (`window.electronAPI`).
- **Electron (`electron/`)**: TypeScript main process + preload.
  - Owns app lifecycle and OS integration (file dialogs, native export via ffmpeg, starting/managing the Python backend).
  - Security: renderer is sandboxed (`contextIsolation: true`, `nodeIntegration: false`).
- **Backend (`backend/`)**: Python + FastAPI local server.
  - Orchestrates generation, model downloads, and GPU execution.
  - Calls external APIs only when API-backed features are used.

## Development (quickstart)

Prereqs:

- Node.js
- `uv` (Python package manager)
- Python 3.12+
- Git

Setup:

```bash
pnpm setup:dev
```

Run:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

Debug:

```bash
pnpm dev:debug
```

`dev:debug` starts Electron with inspector enabled and starts the Python backend with `debugpy`.

Typecheck:

```bash
pnpm typecheck
```

Backend tests:

```bash
pnpm backend:test
```

Building installers:
- See [`INSTALLER.md`](docs/INSTALLER.md)

## Telemetry

LTX Desktop collects minimal, anonymous usage analytics (app version, platform, and a random installation ID) to help prioritize development. No personal information or generated content is collected. Analytics is enabled by default and can be disabled in **Settings > General > Anonymous Analytics**. See [`TELEMETRY.md`](docs/TELEMETRY.md) for details.
